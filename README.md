# The sprint game
My very first game
# Why did I choose this game
I first was about to do a minesweeper and thenby talking with one of the students, this running game idea came to me. It also was a good idea to do something not that complex but using DOM, addEventListener, etc to practice all that stuff, because I still have some issus with it.
# Keys feature
1. Start and Reset button
2. 30 seconds countdown when press start
3. Random keys to press, randomly generated
4. Highscore feature
